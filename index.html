<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Basic website name, might change it so something else. I'm obsessed with the favicon though, I think I'll match the background color to it.-->

<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <p> and </p> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment.

    <p>Vine, released in 2013 under Twitter’s ownership, immediately skyrocketed in popularity, captivating a global audience like no social media had done before. Vine wasn’t just any social media app, it took the world by storm because of its unique but simple form of content. For the first time, an app completely focused on short form looping videos, giving anyone the chance to go viral for anything, including comedy, music, acting, and more. However, this new, creative idea would soon be taken over by newer competitors like Snapchat and TikTok, and Vine's steady downfall would begin. 
In 2016, Twitter, who had acquired the app in 2012, announced that the platform would be shut down and removed from the app store in the coming months. This shocking news launched an outpour of tributes, not only from its popular creators, but also an entire generation who grew up on the app. While Vine's shutdown marked the end and start of a new era of social media, its influence on pop culture and the social media environment persists even 8 years later.</p>

	<p>With Vine’s innovative six-second format not only introducing a new way to consume content but also creating stars who remain household names today, its huge impact on pop culture can’t be denied (Tran, 2023). These creators included musicians like Shawn Mendes, comedians like King Bach, and video editors like Zach King, proving that any kind of content had potential to gain traction on the app. These viral videos transcended Vine, spreading across other platforms, reaching those who never even had the app, and becoming part of the broader internet culture (Rios, 2021). Iconic Vine quotes and clips such as, “what are those?" or a potato flying around a room, will forever exist in the social media vocabulary and continue to be referenced.</p>

	<p>Despite Vine’s short-lived popularity and abrupt shutdown in 2017, the app has had a lasting impact on the current social media environment by paving the way for newer platforms. Vine was the first social media platform to include auto playing short-form videos, allowing for the rise of new types of content creators, audiences, and ways to go viral. Popular Vine creators were some of the first influencers that we now have a surplus of on other platforms like Instagram. As mentioned earlier, stars like Logan Paul and Shawn Mendes got their start after their 6 second videos blew up. Vine was the first example we had of a new genre of content creators, then called Viners, who could go viral and build a fanbase off only a few seconds of content (Dew, 2024). The app even became a helpful tool for the music industry, with both new artists, like Ruth B, and existing artists, like Drake, benefitting from the platform's community and new meme culture (Spanos, 2016). </p>

	<p>An article published on Vox shortly after the shutdown was announced states that the most common comment from non-users was “I just don’t get Vine,” something that most people couldn’t fathom hearing now. Every social media focuses on short-form videos to some degree now, so imagining social media before this creation is a difficult task. The article also mentions that 6 seconds is the ideal amount of time for both the creator and the consumer, because “you can accomplish a lot in six seconds” (Romano, 2016). With a better way to make and interact with content, Vine became a space where people from every corner of the internet could come together and be part of the same community, “providing a perfect, innocuous interruption and respite from the routine of our daily lives,” (Wong, 2022). </p>

	<p>This idea would soon be followed up by Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and most importantly, TikTok (formerly Musical.ly). TikTok launched in 2014 under the name Musical.ly, with a very similar concept to Vine, where creators could post 15 second videos with either music playing over or using an original sound. This new app gained traction slowly but blew up in 2017 -as Vine’s reign came to an end- after being acquired by ByteDance and merging with TikTok (Jalan, 2022). Many Vine creators made the switch to TikTok, lots of them switching even before the shutdown, and were able to continue making the same kind of content on a more versatile and opportune platform (Jalan, 2022). Without Vine, we wouldn’t have the apps and creators that we now love so much. </p>

	<p>In the four years that we had Vine, it had one of the biggest impacts on how we currently interact and consume media, some may argue even more than platforms like Facebook and Tumblr that are still around. Vine transformed social media by making short form videos the norm, a trend still prominent on other apps, inventing an easier way to create and to consume content, proving how even in a short amount of time, an extraordinary change can be made.</p>

<!--Add audience analysis on site or in comments-->
<!--Audience analysis: The target audience for my encomium consists of people who grew up using media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and of course, Vine. This group of people are mostly Gen Z and some younger millennials whose first real experience on social media was Vine. To this group, I aim to educate them on how Vine paved the way for these more successful platforms that now have such a hold on us as well as how they shaped the current climate of pop culture. Also, in today’s world, social media can have a very negative connotation at times, so I intend to turn back time for my audience, allowing them to reflect on a happier and more positive time.-->

 <div class="textblock">
  <h2>Why I chose Vine</h2>
  <p>I chose to use Vine for my encomium because of my personal experience with the app. I was only 7 when the app came out, but it was my first experience with social media. As the app blew up, I started seeing them on YouTube and hearing my older brothers talking about them. The main contributing factor however, was my older cousin. She was moderately popular on the app, launching her career as a comedian, and she featured me in a few of her Vines. I vividly remember visiting her family in Connecticut and helping her make a video in the backyard. This initial exposure to the app had me hooked, and while I was too young to have a phone at the time, I was able to download the app on my moms iPad. I still remember watching the first Vine that showed up when I downloaded the app, a couple singing the song "Santeria" by Sublime. This discovery launched me into the world of social media and not soon after I found Musical.ly (which would become TikTok). When I found out that the app was shutting down, I felt the way that most other watchers did, and always hoped it would come back. Writing my encomium about Vine was my way of brining it back into my life.</p>

  <h2>My Pets</h2>

<!--I miss my pets so I decided to make an extra section based on them. My older border collie, Lucie, is turning 10 in October which is unbelieveable. She's still super playful and spry for her age, she just tends to get grumpy now. I try not to think about her age though. I can't figure out how to make the images side by side and don't know if there is a way to without adding something to the CSS so i might just leave it as is or find another picture.-->

  <p>Featured above are my three pets; 2 Border Collies named Lucie (black) and Luna (gold) as well as a cat named Opal. Lucie and Luna have a love hate relationship; Luna is obsessed with Lucie, but Lucie is frequently annoyed with Luna. In the Summer their favorite activity is swimming in the pool, but in the Winter they love playing in the snow. Opal's favorite activity is sleeping, and when she isn't asleep, she's begging for food or watching the birds outside.</p>
